# FootballDraftAnalysis

This project will scrape NFL data from pro-football-reference.com and store the information in three different objects: 
  Players: 
  College:
  NFLTeam:

These objects will then be printed into a CSV format usable by Gephi, CSVs usable by https://app.flourish.studio/, or html which uses the JavaScript library ViewJS to create a bipartite graph.

The grad project's powerpoint is [here](CNT5805FinalPresentationTeam2.pptx), but the pythin code has been modified since to scrape the data in different ways.
